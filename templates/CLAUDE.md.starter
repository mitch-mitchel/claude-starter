# Dev Environment

<!--
  CLAUDE.md STARTER TEMPLATE

  This file gives Claude Code persistent context about your development environment.
  Place at ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md for global config, or in a project root for project-specific.

  Customize each section for your setup. Delete what doesn't apply.

## Directory Structure & Git Identity

<!-- Map your directory layout so Claude understands where different projects live -->

| Path | Purpose | Remote |
|------|---------|--------|
| `~/work/` | Work projects | GitHub/GitLab |
| `~/personal/` | Personal projects | GitHub |
| `~/oss/` | Open source contributions | GitHub |

<!-- If you use different git identities per directory, note it here -->
Git uses `includeIf` for directory-based email switching.

## Environment

<!-- Your core dev tools - helps Claude suggest compatible commands -->

| Category | Tool |
|----------|------|
| IDE | VS Code |
| Package Manager | Homebrew (`/opt/homebrew/`) |
| Shell | zsh + oh-my-zsh |
| Node Version Manager | fnm / nvm / n |
| Python Environments | venv / pyenv / conda |

## Preferred Frameworks

<!-- Your go-to choices - Claude will default to these when relevant -->

- **JavaScript/TypeScript:** [SvelteKit, React, Next.js, Vue, etc.]
- **Python:** [Django, FastAPI, Flask, etc.]
- **Other:** [Go, Rust, etc.]

## Preferred Tooling by Language

<!-- Be specific - these are the commands Claude will run -->

**Node.js/TypeScript:**
- Lint: `npm run lint` → ESLint
- Format: `npm run format` → Prettier
- Type check: `tsc --noEmit`
- Test: [Vitest, Jest] (unit), [Playwright, Cypress] (e2e)
- Pre-commit: husky + lint-staged

**Python:**
- Lint: `ruff check`
- Format: `ruff format`
- Type check: mypy
- Test: pytest
- Pre-commit: pre-commit

## Git Workflow

<!-- Your commit conventions - Claude will follow these -->

- **Commit format:** Conventional Commits (`type(scope?): description`)
- **Valid types:** feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert
- **Command execution:** Run git commands separately, not chained with `&&` or `;`

## Pre-Commit Workflow

<!-- Important behavioral instruction for Claude -->

Before committing, always run the repo's lint and format commands manually.

**Why:** Pre-commit hooks auto-fix files then abort the commit, requiring re-stage and retry. Running tools first ensures hooks are no-ops and commits succeed on the first attempt.

**Node/TS:** Check package.json scripts, typically:
- `npm run format && npm run lint --fix`

**Python:** Check pyproject.toml/ruff.toml, typically:
- `ruff format . && ruff check --fix`

Stage all changes after formatting, then commit.

## Principles

<!-- Your coding philosophy - guides Claude's decisions -->

1. Native global configs preferred over per-project duplication
2. Reuse and composition (DRY)
3. Separation of concerns
4. Simple solutions over clever ones
5. [Add your own...]
